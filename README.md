# Data Visualisation

This is a repo with some of my procrastination projects. We all have those so don't judge.

## Standard Model

Initial idea: Niko. Code: Niko (me) and Matthijs ([his website](https://mlwild.net)). Code based on [Bokeh](https://docs.bokeh.org/en/latest/) Periodic System of Elements [interactive plot](https://docs.bokeh.org/en/latest/docs/gallery/periodic.html). 

Due to Bokeh not having the tex implementation yet [they are working on it](https://github.com/bokeh/bokeh/blob/branch-2.4/examples/models/file/latex_extension.py), I thought of going around it and using images for particle symbols. If someone has an idea how to actually make tex work in this case - feel free to comment.

I copied the data from what I found on Wikipedia. If some values are wrong, let me know (don't come at me, HEP people :D).

The hover is hard to format so if you have any ideas how to improve - also comment.

Hope you like it.

Free to use on your websites, as long as you credit the original source. For now you can just credit this repo, I have to come up with a better way.

Best,
Niko&Matthijs
